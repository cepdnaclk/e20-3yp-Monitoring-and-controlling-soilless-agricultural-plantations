## Introduction

Welcome to the future of farming! Our cutting-edge IoT-based system is designed to transform hydroponic farming into an efficient, sustainable, and user-friendly solution. By introducing smart sensor devices, we provide real-time monitoring and control like never before.

One sensor continuously analyzes the hydroponic medium, ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth, while another tracks key atmospheric parameters. Complementing these sensors is an automated fertilizer dispenser and a fluid circulation motor, maintaining a perfect balance for your crops.

With live updates and full control accessible through our mobile application, urban farmers and multidisciplinary researchers can now manage their farms with ease and precision. Our mission is to encourage urban communities to embrace farming and contribute to advancing research in sustainable agriculture.
